      <h2>News</h2>
      <p>2024.09: Completed Bachelor of Science in Statistics at The University of British Columbia. Currently preparing for PhD applications to advance research in industrial monitoring and social system analysis.</p>

      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I am a recent graduate in Statistics with a deep interest in data science, machine learning, and causal inference. Through hands-on research in both industrial and social data contexts, I have developed a versatile skill set in data-driven modeling, complex systems analysis, and scientific decision-making.</p>
      <p>Under the mentorship of Dr. Liang Cao, I conducted research on interpretable soft sensors, applying models like SHAP and Extremely Randomized Trees to enhance transparency in industrial processes. This research was presented at conferences such as IFAC and CCEC and has fostered my passion for translating complex data into actionable insights. My research has also extended to social systems, where I worked with Professor Mia Raynard on analyzing global media sentiment in relation to regulatory policies, employing statistical techniques like MANOVA and causal inference tools such as gCastle.</p>
      <p>Driven by the goal of using data to unravel complex phenomena, my work bridges the realms of industrial process optimization and social sentiment analysis, contributing to more informed, data-backed decision-making.</p>

      <h2>On-Going Projects</h2>
      <h3>Adaptive Process Monitoring for Multiphase Industrial Processes</h3>
      <p>In collaboration with Dr. Liang Cao, this project focuses on developing adaptive soft sensor models that integrate Gaussian Mixture Models and Change Point Detection for real-time monitoring in multi-stage industrial environments. These models provide accurate predictions across varying operational conditions, improving both reliability and operational efficiency.</p>
      
      <h3>Media Sentiment Analysis and Causal Inference in Regulatory Events</h3>
      <p>Working with Professor Mia Raynard, I am exploring the impact of regulatory events on public sentiment towards alternative proteins. Using causal inference and survival analysis, we are quantifying the patterns of sentiment change post-regulation, providing a nuanced view of media influence on public opinion.</p>

      <h2>Publications</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>[IFAC ADCHEM 2024]</strong>: Interpretable Industrial Soft Sensor Design Based on Informer and SHAP - Co-authored with Dr. Liang Cao, this paper discusses the use of SHAP explanations in time-series forecasting, enabling operators to understand and trust model predictions.</li>
        <li><strong>[IEEE Trans. Ind. Cyber-Phys. Syst.]</strong>: Adaptive Process Monitoring for Multiphase Industrial Processes using Machine Learning - Developed a novel framework incorporating Gaussian Mixture Models for data segmentation, enhancing prediction accuracy across industrial processes.</li>
        <li><strong>[CCEC 2023]</strong>: Interpretable Early Fault Detection Method - Presented at the Canadian Chemical Engineering Conference, this poster highlights a method for early fault detection in industrial settings.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
      <p>When not working on research, I enjoy long-distance running, painting, and reading about philosophy, especially topics in Stoicism and Zhuangzi.</p>
